# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-ML
This notebook contains three different classifiers for prediction of heart disease: KNeighbour, Decision Trees, Random forests
Project Description:
The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the risk of developing heart disease in individuals based on various health indicators and risk factors. The model will be trained on a dataset containing information on patients' medical history, lifestyle choices, physiological measurements, and other relevant attributes.
