# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-ML
This notebook contains three different classifiers for prediction of heart disease: KNeighbour, Decision Trees, Random forests
Project Description:
The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the risk of developing heart disease in individuals based on various health indicators and risk factors. The model will be trained on a dataset containing information on patients' medical history, lifestyle choices, physiological measurements, and other relevant attributes.

Key Steps:

Data Collection: Gather a comprehensive dataset of patients' health records, including details such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, family history of heart disease, smoking habits, and exercise patterns. This data can be sourced from hospitals, medical research institutions, or publicly available health databases.

Data Preprocessing: Clean the dataset by addressing missing values, removing outliers, and standardizing the data. Additionally, perform feature engineering to derive new features that may have predictive value, such as body mass index (BMI) or indicators for high-risk behaviors.

Feature Selection: Identify the most informative features that strongly correlate with the risk of heart disease. Utilize techniques like correlation analysis, feature importance from tree-based models, or domain knowledge to select the relevant attributes for training the model.

Model Selection: Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for binary classification. Consider algorithms such as logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting algorithms like XGBoost or LightGBM. Experiment with different algorithms to determine the best-performing one.

Model Training: Split the preprocessed dataset into training and testing sets. Train the selected model on the training data, fine-tuning hyperparameters to optimize its performance. Consider using techniques like cross-validation to evaluate the model's generalization ability and avoid overfitting.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model using suitable performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or AUC-ROC. Analyze the model's predictions and performance to assess its ability to correctly identify individuals at risk of heart disease.

Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model into a production environment that can handle new patient data. This can involve building a user-friendly web interface, developing an API for integration into existing healthcare systems, or deploying the model on a cloud-based platform.

Model Monitoring and Updates: Continuously monitor the model's performance in the production environment and consider updating it periodically as new data becomes available. Regularly retrain the model to account for changing patterns and evolving risk factors associated with heart disease.

The completion of this project will provide a machine learning model capable of identifying individuals at risk of developing heart disease. Such a tool can assist healthcare professionals in early detection and prevention efforts, allowing for timely interventions and lifestyle modifications to reduce the incidence and severity of heart disease.
